Matlab functions for sampling transition matrices that satisfy detailed balance and give 
valid rate matrices, using Gerhard Hummer's prescription for MCMC on a parameterization of valid rate matrices.

Transition matrices satisfy relation

Tij = expm(Kij * tau)

where Tij(i,j) is a row-stochastic transition matrix, Kij is a rate matrix where Kij(i,j) > 0 for i ~= j, and sum(Kij(i,:)) = 0 for any i.

Tij and Kij both satisfy detailed balance.

Tij(i,j) represents the probability of observing the system in state j at time tau given it was initial in state i at time 0.
